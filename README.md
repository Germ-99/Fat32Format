# Fat32Format
This tool lets you format USB drives as FAT32 regardless of size.

And before you remind me; *YES* I know that there is already an existing tool for this.

The only reason I wrote this is because the website containing the binaries for said existing tool seems to go down every other day.

# How to Install

## Windows
Simply download the ``Fat32Format.exe`` binary [here](https://github.com/Germ-99/Fat32Format/releases)

If you want to know how to use it, go [here](https://github.com/Germ-99/Fat32Format/blob/main/doc/HowTo.md#windows)


## Linux

**If you're on Arch linux**
Fat32Format can be downloaded via the AUR using a helper like [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay)
```shell
yay -S fat32format
```

**If you're not on Arch linux**
Simply run the following command:
```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Germ-99/Fat32Format/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

# Contributing
I don't really plan on updating this, mainly because this tool is only for my own selfish reasons. 

That being said, if you want to contribute just open a pull request and describe what you changed. I'll look at it when I can.
